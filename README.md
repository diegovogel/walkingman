# The Walking Man Game

The walking man walks. And now we know where he's going. Win challenges and you get the privilege of choosing his next destination. Why? That's too many questions. Just play.

## What is this really?

Fine it's just a little learning playground. 

### Some concepts I want to include/explore

- Audio processing.
- Video/image recognition with AI.
- User accounts.
