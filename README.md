The walking man walks. And now we know where he's going. 

Win challenges and you get the privilege of choosing his next destination. Why? That's too many questions. Just play.

## What is this really?

Fine it's just a playground for learning and improving skills.

### Some concepts I want to include/explore

  - Microphone

- Audio processing.
- Video/image recognition with AI.
- Event-driven architecture.
- User accounts.
