# agent-env.sh: isolated parallel environments for coding agents.
#
# Each environment is a git worktree under .claude/worktrees/<name> (the
# runtime's native location, so Claude sessions can EnterWorktree into it),
# provisioned with everything needed to run this project in isolation:
# copy-on-write-cloned dependencies (near-zero disk until divergence), a config
# file with a unique port set, and a logs dir. Several environments run side by
# side without colliding on ports, dependencies, or branches.
#
# Usage:
#   agent-env.sh create <name> [base-ref] [--resume]  # worktree + branch + provision
#                                          # --resume reattaches an existing branch
#   agent-env.sh provision [path]          # provision an existing worktree (default: cwd)
#   agent-env.sh run <name|path> -- <cmd...>  # run a command IN the env, cwd-independent
#   agent-env.sh serve <name|path> [--main-ports]
#   agent-env.sh stop <name|path>
#   agent-env.sh list
#   agent-env.sh destroy <name|path> [--force]  # deletes the branch only if merged
#   agent-env.sh install-hooks             # install git hooks that reconcile deps after a pull (setup; auto-run by provision)
#   agent-env.sh sync-deps                 # reconcile deps if a pull changed a lockfile (called by the git hooks)
#
# Inside an env, ALWAYS use `serve`, never the main dev command, which is
# pinned to the main checkout's ports and would collide.
