// Refuse the main dev command inside an agent environment. The main dev command
// is pinned to the main checkout's ports, so running it from an env worktree
// collides with the main checkout's dev server. `provision` writes
// .agent-env.json into every env, so its presence in cwd is the signal.
// Cross-platform (Node) because dev must run on macOS and Windows.
//
// Wire it as the first step of the dev script, e.g. in package.json:
//   "dev": "node scripts/guard-not-in-env.cjs && <your real dev command>"
//
// ADAPT: the command names in the message below to match this project.
